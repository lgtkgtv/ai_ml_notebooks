Alright — here’s a starter `.secrets.baseline` so `detect-secrets` doesn’t flag your repo immediately.
This baseline tells the hook “I already scanned the repo and approved what’s there,” so only **new** potential secrets will fail.

## **.secrets.baseline**

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "plugins_used": [
    {
      "name": "AWSKeyDetector"

### How to use this baseline in your repo

1. Save it at repo root as:

   ```
   .secrets.baseline
   ```
2. Add it to Git:

   ```bash
   git add .secrets.baseline
   git commit -m "chore(pre-commit): add initial secrets baseline"
   ```
3. Your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` already points detect-secrets to this baseline, so the hook will now only flag **newly added** suspicious strings.

---

This makes your setup **plug-and-play** — you won’t get blocked on the first commit, but you’ll still prevent new leaks.

Do you want me to also give you the **GitHub Actions job** that runs `detect-secrets` on pull requests so it’s enforced in CI, not just locally?

That would make this airtight even if someone disables pre-commit.

Yes
---

Perfect — here’s a **GitHub Actions** workflow that enforces your `detect-secrets` pre-commit hook in CI. It runs on every PR and **fails** if any *new* secrets appear (your `.secrets.baseline` keeps “known/approved” findings from blocking you).

## **.github/workflows/secrets.yml**

```yaml
name: Secrets guard

on:
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - "docs/**"
      - "**/*.md"
      - "**/*.png"
      - "**/*.jpg"
      - "**/*.gif"
      - "**/*.svg"

jobs:
  detect-secrets:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Pre-commit action runs all hooks defined in .pre-commit-config.yaml
      # including detect-secrets that points at .secrets.baseline
      - name: Run pre-commit (detect-secrets)
        uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.1
        with:
          extra_args: --all-files

      # Optional: Fail fast if baseline is missing or not staged with the PR
      - name: Ensure baseline exists
        run: |
          test -f .secrets.baseline || (echo "::error ::.secrets.baseline missing"; exit 1)
```

### What this does

* Uses your existing **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** (with the `detect-secrets` hook + `.secrets.baseline`) and runs it against the PR’s files.
* CI **fails only on new secrets** that aren’t in the baseline.

---

## Optional: add TruffleHog as a second line of defense

If you want an extra scan (entropy + vendor detectors) that doesn’t rely on a baseline:

```yaml
  trufflehog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # scan full history for this branch
      - name: TruffleHog PR diff scan
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@v3.82.7
        with:
          base: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
          head: ${{ github.sha }}
```

This job scans the **diff** between PR head and base for secrets and fails if it finds any.

---

## Next steps (quick)

1. Save the workflow(s) above as:

   * `.github/workflows/secrets.yml`
   * (optional) add the TruffleHog job to the same file or a separate one.

2. Commit & push on a branch, open a PR.

3. In **Repo → Settings → Branches**:

   * Require a pull request before merging.
   * **Require status checks to pass** → select **Secrets guard** (and TruffleHog if enabled).

That’s it — now both **local commits** (pre-commit) and **PRs** (Actions) will block secret leaks.

If you want, I can also give you a **baseline refresh** workflow (manual dispatch) to rotate the `.secrets.baseline` in a controlled way.
